I learned about the main problems that can be solved with recurring networks;
Understood the data flow in an RNN;
I learned about the advantages of the PyTorch framework for manipulating sequences;
Implement solutions with advanced architectures such as LSTM and GRU;
I learned the basics of word processing. In addition to working with the Torchtext package with datasets, pre-trained models and tools for textual data.
